DESCRIPTION =Deploys a single instance and runs the Intel-optimized linpack benchmark.\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_PROFILE possible values: _PROFILES_ (single instance).\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_LEVEL meaning: problem size (square root of the matrix size),\n
DESCRIPTION +=    multiplied by the LOAD_FACTOR.\n 
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when the problem is solved.\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - COMMENT: For clustered (multi-instance) linpack execution, please use HPCC.
